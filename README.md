## Usage Instructions

### Building an Algorithm
1. Drag and drop algorithm components from the palette onto the canvas.
2. Connect components with lines to define the flow of the algorithm.
3. Customize the properties and behavior of each component directly on the canvas.
4. Use the code generation feature to convert the visual representation into actual code.
5. Test and debug your algorithm within the app.

### Customizing Algorithm Templates
1. Select a pre-built algorithm template from the library.
2. Modify parameters, add or remove steps, and change the logic as needed.
3. Save and share your customized algorithm with others.

### Interactive Learning Platform
1. Access guided tutorials and exercises to learn about different algorithms.
2. Follow step-by-step explanations and visualizations of how each algorithm works.
3. Practice implementing algorithms and receive instant feedback.
4. Experiment with your own algorithm ideas in the sandbox environment.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Installation Issues
- Ensure you have the correct versions of Node.js and npm installed.
- Check your internet connection and try running `npm install` again.
- If you encounter permission issues, try running the commands with `sudo`.

### Usage Issues
- If the app is not loading, ensure the development server is running and you are navigating to the correct URL.
- For drag-and-drop issues, try refreshing the page or clearing your browser cache.
- If you encounter errors in the generated code, use the debugging environment to identify and fix the issues.
